        "Welcome to Computer Science! üöÄ In this first chapter, we'll dive into the basics of programming using **Python**, a powerful and popular language known for its simple, readable syntax. We'll also use a special graphics library called **`pytamaro`** to create interesting visuals right from the start.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why These Tools?\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Python:** It's a fantastic language for beginners because its syntax is close to English, letting you focus on programming concepts rather than complex rules. It's also used by professionals at places like Google, NASA, and Spotify.\n",
        "* **`pytamaro`:** Learning to code is more fun when you can see your results. This library makes it easy to draw shapes, create images, and learn core programming ideas in a visual way.\n",
        "* **Jupyter Notebooks:** This interactive environment, which you're looking at right now, lets us mix live code, explanatory text, and images all in one place. It‚Äôs the perfect digital workbook for learning and experimenting.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How Will We Work and Learn?\n",
        "\n",
        "Writing programs takes time and perseverance. I will be giving you time to work independently on various coding exercises. Please use your time during the lessons efficiently. The first exam will cover basic Python programming skills and some theory and definitions. It will be a pen and paper exam. Make sure you practice writing code down and thinking about the output while practicing.\n",

        "To run a code cell, you can either click the \"play\" button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) that appears to its left or select the cell and press `Ctrl+Enter`. This executes the Python code inside and shows the output directly below. You can click on any code cell to edit its contents.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Working with Text Cells**\n",
        "The text you're reading is in a **Markdown cell**. Markdown is a simple way to format text using plain characters. To see the \"raw\" text, just double-click on a text cell. To render it again, press `Ctrl+Enter`.\n",

        "Here are a few basic Markdown commands:\n",
        "* `# Title` creates a main heading, `## Subtitle` creates a smaller one.\n",

        "* `**text**` makes text **bold**.\n",
        "* `` `code` `` formats text as `inline code`.\n",
        "* `*` makes an bullet list (such as this one)\n",
        "* `1.` makes a numbered list (the exact numbers are displayed correctly - so even if you add new entries, you do not have to change the numebring) \n",
        "\n",
        "### Saving your Work\n",
        "As with other documents and files the command `CTRL-S` (or `CMD-S`) saves your progress locally. Please make sure to regularly use this to save your progress. At the end of a session or lesson it makes sense to save your work more persistently. At the bottom of the page you will find a button labelled `Commit and Push`. This will take care of the git commands needed to connect with your online repository. Please use this button at the end of every lesson and also in between when you have worked on a large chunk. The version on your repository can be viewed by me to assess your progress and see if there are any issues that we need to look at.\n",
